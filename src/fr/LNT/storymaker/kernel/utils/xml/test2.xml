			<text>Teacher : Blah blah blah... project... \n
				Your eyes are
				fluttering. Fatigue inavdes you. Slowly, the room around
				you
				disappears. You must recognize that Jovo's classes have never
				been
				your strength....as evidenced by your grades in the last test.
				You
				feel your eyelids become heavier and heavier \n
				- BAM ! \n
				You make up
				with a start ! Around you, the students have already
				started to leave
				the amphitheater. It was their noisy
				discussionsthat got you out of
				sleep. Very quickly, you are the only
				one still sitting. The teacher
				glares at you from his desk. He
				propably wants to go on a lunch break
				or maybe he noticed that you
				slept the entire lecture... You look
				away.
				On your right, you notice a young long-haired girl who are
				smiling at
				you. On your left, there is a bearded boy hypnotised by
				his phone.
				The exit of the amphitheater are calling you : it's the
				freedom's
				door. You finally decide to get up.
